# Encryption and decryption

This folder covers the implementation of classic encryption and decryption algorithms such as Vigenere encryption and Row transposition encryption. The aim is to study the strengths and weaknesses of these methods. 

There are two python files:
- `A1.py`: python file containing the implementation of the encryption methods.
- `A1_test.py`: python file used to test the correct operation of the algorithms in `A1.py`.

## Required libraries

All the libraries in the list below must be on your machine in order to run the two python files.

- pytest
- string
- itertools
- datetime
- math
- matplotlib.pyplot
- numpy
- typing

If you don't have one of these libraries, you can install it using the python pip package manager.

`pip install <librarie's name>`

Or using requirements.txt like this:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run the code

Open a terminal in the A1 folder. You can then enter the following instruction to run the main program:

`python3 A1.py`

## Test the code

In orer to test the code, you have to enter the following intsruction always in a terminal in the A1 folder:

`pytest A1.py A1_test.py`
